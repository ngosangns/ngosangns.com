1. Generate OpenSSH here: [https://8gwifi.org/sshfunctions.jsp](https://8gwifi.org/sshfunctions.jsp)

2. Add public key to **Deploy keys.**

3. Add private key to `~/.ssh/` on hosting.

4. Setup `~/.ssh/config` on hosting:

```
Host github.com-<repo>
    Hostname github.com
    IdentityFile=~/.ssh/<private-key>
```

5. And finally you can clone repo with SSH.

```
git clone <git@github.com><repo>:<username>/<repo>.git
```

5.1. If you got key permission errors

    chmod 700 ~/.ssh
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*
